! the current `package.json` only deploys the front end (back end is hosted on https://the-backend.glitch.me/ on glitch). But the back end code is (manually) synced to `backend` folder.

vite for frontend / node (express) for backend API

please set

    FRONTEND_PORT=3000
    BACKEND_PORT=40000

in .env first
